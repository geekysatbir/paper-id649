## Publication Status
Camera-ready version submitted for publication.

## Code Implementation

This repository includes a Python implementation of the AI observability and monitoring system described in the paper.

### Features
- **Model Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of model performance, latency, and resource usage
- **Drift Detection**: Statistical methods for detecting data drift and model degradation
- **Observability Dashboard**: Centralized monitoring for multiple AI models
- **Real-time Alerts**: Automated alerting for performance issues

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
python ai_observability_system.py
```

### Key Components

1. **ModelMonitor**: Tracks performance metrics and generates alerts
2. **DriftDetector**: Detects data distribution changes
3. **ObservabilityDashboard**: Unified view of all monitored models
